# Commons

This repository contains common type definitions and other common code between
[backend](https://github.com/umut-onur/Ceng453_TermProject_Group1_backend) and
[frontend](https://github.com/umut-onur/Ceng453_TermProject_Group1_frontend) repositories.

It is intended to be used via [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/), a Java repository that allows importing arbitrary GitHub
repositories as dependency.

### Using JitPack
For each commit we add to this repository, since it's a public one, we can see the list of commits at
https://jitpack.io/#umut-onur/Ceng453_TermProject_Group1_commons. There, we can select the commit we want to build
and click `Get it` button, which will
1. trigger the build for that commit
2. show the maven dependency for it

After build is complete, we can just copy-paste that configuration to `pom.xml`.
